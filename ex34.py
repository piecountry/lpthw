# Study Drills

# 1. January 1, 2010 is a date. The order in which things happen is the ciritcal part, so dates are ordinal. That's why 1/1/2010 is in the year 2010 not 2009.

# 2. study_list = ['Darwin', 'Churchill', 'Roosevelt', 'Lincoln', 'Johnson', 'Jefferson', 'Washington']
#     The only scientist is at 0 and is Darwin.
#     The biggest fan of America is at 1 and is Churchill.
#     The seventh man is at 6 and is Washington.
#     The giant at 3 is Lincoln.

# 3. study_list[0] == 'Darwin',
#     study_list[1] == 'Churchill',
#     study_list[6] == 'Washington'
#     study_list[3] == 'Lincoln'
