# -: minus                  Subtraction
# /: slash                  Division
# *: asterisk               Multiplication
# %: percent                Modulus
# **: double asterisk       Exponentiation
# //: double slash          Floor division      Divide the first number by the second number and rounds the result down to the nearest integer (or whole number)

Comparison Operators
# <: less_than              Less than	x < y
# >: greater_than           Greater than
# <=: less_than_equal       Less than or equal to
# >=: greater_than_equal    Greater than or equal to
# ==: double Equal          Equal	x == y
# !=: bang Equal            Not equal	x != y
# >: greater than	        	x > y
# <:
# >=:	                    	x >= y
# <=:	                    	x <= y

Assignment Operators
# =:	x = 5	x = 5
# +=:	x += 3	x = x + 3
# -=:	x -= 3	x = x - 3
# *=:	x *= 3	x = x * 3
# /=:	x /= 3	x = x / 3
# %=:	x %= 3	x = x % 3
# //=:	x //= 3	x = x // 3
# **=:	x **= 3	x = x ** 3
# &=:	x &= 3	x = x & 3
# |=:	x |= 3	x = x | 3
# ^=:	x ^= 3	x = x ^ 3
# >>=:	x >>= 3	x = x >> 3
# <<=:	x <<= 3	x = x << 3
